# Overview

Coomer Finance is a notification service that alerts you to new alpha projects. It monitors the Ethereum blockchain scanning for transactions that interact with previous unknown contracts, assets, etc... It then uses this information to fine-tune further searches to discover even more alpha. It consists of two products, an email service that allows notifying subscribers of new alpha on a monthly, or weekly bais, along with a discord bot that provides access to the information as soon as it is discovered.

# Costs

The costs of Coomer Finance depend on the notification system you are subscribed to. Monthly email subscription costs $25/month, weekly email subscription costs $50/month. For instant access to the information a discord bot is available which costs $1000/month per discord server the bot is added to. The discord subscription also comes with an API that can be used. 

An important thing to note about the discord bot is that it doesn't filter any of the information, it simply sends the information to a discord channel as it comes in, as such there may be a heavy amount of noise produced by this bot. The email service on the otherhand takes this information, and filters out the noise so that it only sends you the relevant information.
